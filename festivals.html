                    </li>
                    <li>The festival lasts for 10 days, beginning on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the Hindu month Bhadrapada (August–September) and concluding with the immersion (Visarjan) of Ganesha idols in water bodies on the tenth day.
                        The festival usually falls between August and September, depending on the lunar calendar.
                    </li>
                    <li>Devotees install clay or plaster idols of Ganesha in homes and public pandals (temporary stages), performing rituals such as chanting Vedic hymns, prayers, aarti (lamp worship), and offering sweets like modak, which is considered Ganesha’s favorite.
                        The idols are often beautifully decorated with flowers, lights, and ornaments, creating a festive atmosphere.
                    </li>
                    <li>The festival is not only religious but also a social and cultural event featuring music, dance, folk songs, and community gatherings that foster unity and joy among participants.
                        It is a time for people to come together, celebrate, and express their devotion to Ganesha.
                    </li>
                    <li>The final ritual, Ganpati Visarjan, involves a grand procession where the idol is immersed in a river, sea, or ocean, symbolizing Ganesha’s return to his celestial abode and the impermanence of life.
                        This act is accompanied by chants of "Ganapati Bappa Morya" and signifies the cycle of creation and dissolution in Hindu philosophy.
