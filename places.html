            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Borra Caves are among the largest and deepest limestone caves in India, located in the Ananthagiri Hills of the Eastern Ghats at an elevation of about 705 meters. These karstic caves extend up to 80 meters deep and span over approximately two square kilometers. 
                    They feature spectacular stalactite and stalagmite formations created over millions of years by the erosional action of water on limestone, resulting in unique shapes resembling animals, human figures, and deities, such as the famous natural Shivalinga inside the caves</li>
                    <li>Discovered in 1807 by British geologist William King, Borra Caves hold immense archaeological importance. Paleolithic and Neolithic tools found in the region indicate early human habitation dating back tens of thousands of years. 
                    The caves also contain ancient inscriptions and have been a site of continuous natural formation, making them a valuable resource for geological and anthropological research.</li>
                    <li>The caves are not only a natural marvel but also a significant cultural and religious site, housing a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, revered by local tribal communities. 
                    They attract numerous tourists and pilgrims, especially between October and March when the weather is pleasant. The caves contribute substantially to the local economy through tourism, offering visitors a unique blend of natural beauty, spiritual significance, and historical heritage.</li>

                    <li>Katiki Waterfalls is a stunning cascade located near Araku Valley, about 7 km from the famous Borra Caves in Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh. 
                    The waterfall is formed by the Gosthani River and falls from a height of approximately 50 to 100 feet, surrounded by dense forests and rocky terrain of the Eastern Ghats. 
                    This makes it an ideal spot for nature lovers, photographers, and those seeking tranquility amidst lush greenery.</li>
                    <li>Reaching Katiki Falls requires a moderate trek of about 20-30 minutes through forested and hilly terrain, starting near the Borra Caves area. 
                    The trek offers a mix of easy and challenging paths, including rocky patches and streams, providing an adventurous experience along with opportunities to observe diverse flora and fauna.
                    Proper footwear is recommended due to slippery and uneven surfaces, especially near the waterfall.</li>
                    <li>Katiki Falls is also popular for camping, where visitors can enjoy bonfires, cook local delicacies, and spend the night under the stars. 
                    A unique local specialty is "Bamboo chicken," marinated chicken cooked inside bamboo sticks, which is highly sought after by tourists. Visitors are advised to avoid weekends and public holidays to escape crowds, be cautious of slippery paths, and prefer jeep transport as roads are rough for regular vehicles. 
                    The best time to visit is during the monsoon and post-monsoon months (August to December) when the waterfall is at its fullest and most beautiful.</li>

                  <li>Chaparai Waterfalls, also known as Dumbriguda Waterfalls, is located about 13-15 km from Araku Valley in Andhra Pradesh. 
                    It is nestled amidst lush green forests and surrounded by dense vegetation, making it a picturesque and tranquil spot ideal for nature lovers. 
                    The waterfall is not a traditional vertical fall but a cascading stream flowing over smooth, slanting rock formations, creating natural water slides and pools perfect for swimming and relaxing</li>
                <li>The site offers exciting opportunities for trekking through the forest trails leading to the waterfall, with a moderately challenging trek of around 2 km. 
                    The natural water slides formed by polished rocks provide a thrilling experience for adventure seekers. Visitors can also enjoy camping, swimming, and picnicking in the serene environment. 
                    However, caution is advised during the monsoon season due to strong water flow and slippery rocks.</li>
                <li>The ideal visiting period is post-monsoon (October to February) when the water flow is pleasant and the surroundings are lush green. 
                    Although the waterfall can be visited year-round, the monsoon months (June to September) offer a spectacular view of the falls in full force but require extra caution. Entry is free, and the site is open from early morning to evening. 
                    Visitors are encouraged to respect the environment by avoiding littering and plastic use.</li>

                    <li>The INS Kurusura Submarine Museum is housed inside a real, decommissioned Indian Navy submarine, INS Kurusura, which was a Russian-built I-641 class submarine commissioned in 1970 and decommissioned in 2001 after 31 years of service. 
                    It is the first submarine converted into a museum in Asia and the second in the world, making it a rare and significant naval heritage site.</li>

                    Guides, many of whom are former Navy personnel, enhance the experience with detailed explanations.</li>
                    <li>Located on Ramakrishna Beach in Visakhapatnam, the museum is well-maintained and attracts numerous tourists, history buffs, and military enthusiasts. 
                    It serves both as an educational resource on submarine technology and naval history and as a source of inspiration for youth interested in joining the Indian Navy.
